<details>
<summary><strong>Create TEMP Table for Q-2 to Q-8</strong></summary>

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS measure_count, 
    COUNT( DISTINCT measure) AS unique_measure 
  FROM
    health.user_logs
  GROUP BY
    1
);
```

SELECT
  measure,
  frequency,
  ROUND(
    100 * frequency :: NUMERIC / SUM(frequency) OVER() ,
    2

  ROUND(
    100 * SUM(
      CASE
        WHEN unique_measure >= 2 THEN 1
