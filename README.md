|--|
| 554 |

<details>
<summary><strong>Create TEMP Table for Q-2 to Q-8</strong></summary>

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_measure_count;
CREATE TEMP TABLE user_measure_count AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    COUNT(*) AS measure_count, 
    COUNT( DISTINCT measure) AS unique_measure , 
    SUM( COUNT( DISTINCT measure) ) as total_unique_measure
  FROM
    health.user_logs
  GROUP BY
    1
);
```

</details>

|Question 4 | How many users have 3 or more measurements? |
|--|--|

<details>

```sql
WITH group_by_measure AS (
  SELECT
    DISTINCT id,
    measure
  FROM
    health.user_logs
)
SELECT
  measure,
  COUNT(*) AS frequency,
  ROUND (
    100 * COUNT(*) :: NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(),
    2
  ) AS percent
FROM
  group_by_measure
GROUP BY
  measure
```

</details>

| measure | frequency | percent | 
| -- | -- | -- | 
| blood_pressure| 123 | 15.22 | 
| **blood_glucose** | **325** | **40.22** | 
| weight        | 360 | 44.55 | 


|Question 7 | number and percentage of the active user base who have at least 2 types of measurements? |

<details>
<summary><i>SQL Query</i></summary>

```sql

SELECT
  '2_or_more' AS unique_measure_count , 
  COUNT(*) AS frequency , 
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) :: NUMERIC / AVG(total_uninque_measure), 2) AS percent 
FROM
  user_measure_count
WHERE 
  unique_measure >= 2
